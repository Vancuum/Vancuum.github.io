Hi, I'm Bennett. I'm a 5th year UBC electrical engineering student pursuing a minor in honours math. Academically and professionally, I'm interested in communication systems and information theory. 

I'm currently serving my second year as VP Academic of the UBC Electrical and Computer Engineering Student Society (ECESS), where I've helped students by running tutoring sessions, collecting their feedback, and advocating for curricular improvement.

I was previously a canoe trip guide at the Taylor Statten Camps, leading a 36 day canoe trip through Quetico in 2023.

In my spare time, I like to play electric bass with my band and read fiction.
